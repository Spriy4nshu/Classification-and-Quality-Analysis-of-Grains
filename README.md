# Classification-and-Quality-Analysis-of-Grains
Application of Deep Neural Network for classification and quality analysis of Grains


Resnet 34 was used for accurate classification of different types lentils and rices. Multiple classes were created to optimize the quality analysis for various grains.
Dataset was created from scratch in both controlled and unconstrained enviornment to overcome overfitting of the model.
